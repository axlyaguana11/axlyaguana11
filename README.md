# Welcome to my GitHub repo 👋
Hi there! Here you'll find about me, my projects and some of my blog articles about **data science**.

## Who am I? 🤵
My name is Axel Yaguana (hi/him/his). I like to use data to solve problems and help people. Since I was a child I was interested in science and, maybe, that's why I'm pursuing a career in data science. One of my values is **never stop learning**. That's the key to face uncertainty and achieve goals.

I live in my home city Loja with my cat and dog. 🐾 I work remotely from here.

## Blog articles 📜
As I never stop learning, I never stop sharing knowledge. So, I started blogging about data science on Medium. Some blogs are in Spanish and others in English.
